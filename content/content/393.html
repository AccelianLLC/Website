								Strategy and Finance
							</h2>
						
						<p>In the modern world, pressure abounds from all directions to drive greater results out of fewer resources. At first, this tightrope can seem daunting, if not impossible, to achieve. However, driving more from less becomes realistic through a disciplined approach to decide what is truly important to an organization while focusing limited resources into only that which is truly important. Accelian's Strategy and Financial Management expertise solves the puzzle of doing more with less by turning organizational priorities into a shared vision that is aligned with available resources.</p><h4>Capabilities</h4><p>Accelian delivers proven experts to meet clients' management consulting needs. Our team has extensive experience in all aspects of organizational management, including:<ul><li>Strategic Planning</li><li>Federal Government Level 1 Program Management</li><li>Commercial Organization Operations Management</li><li>Performance Management</li><li>Operational and Financial Modeling</li><li>Budget Formulation and Investment/Capital Planning</li><li>Financial Control and Oversight</li><li>Product Delivery</li><li>Major Systems Implementations</li><li>Project Cost/Schedule Control</li><li>High-Profile Stakeholder Communications</li></ul></p><h4>Strategic Planning</h4><p>To best manage an organization, there needs to be a clear set of goals and objectives understood and pursued by all the members of that organization. Without a clear direction around which to coordinate efforts, the organization will begin to undergo a vicious cycle of lost focus, declining morale, and declining mission results. While Accelian finds that almost all clients have a document called a strategic plan, we have found that many still struggle to control costs, maintain workforce morale, and improve organizational results. In these cases, the available strategic plan is almost always out of date, is not integrated with other management efforts, lacks achievable objectives understood by organizational staff beyond senior leadership, and pays no heed to prioritization. In other words, among many other challenges, their organization is disconnected from its strategy. To begin a virtuous cycle yielding improved mission results, the organization must refocus itself on achieving what is truly important within its organizational constraints. Accelian works with organizational leaders to establish a vision for the organization. As importantly, we turn to working level staff for potential tangible actions that will achieve the target vision. From these inputs, we look to build a focused set of realistic, resource-constrained objectives aligned to achieve the established strategic vision.</p><h4>Program (Operational) and Financial Management</h4><p>With a sound strategy in place, the long-term challenge to set and keep the organization moving toward its stated plan begins. First, Accelian assembles existing detailed programmatic, operational, capital, and financial plans. We then move to align and reassess these plans in light of organizational strategic priorities and operational impacts. To execute this task, Accelian places great emphasis on understanding the links between financial flows and operational success so that revisions of financial plans do not cut off important operational capabilities or create excess operational capacities not needed due to constraints in other operational areas. We then propose recommended plan changes to the client for consideration. Once the client approves final revised detailed programmatic, operational, capital, and financial plans - Accelian next works with the client to strengthen controls that ensure adherence to plans. Further, we look to push the planning process forward in time to better project organizational results from given resources constraints. Finally, we strengthen and encourage the embedding of change management processes into core operations that encourage plans to evolve without deviating from core strategies and established budget levels. This fosters a virtuous cycle that will coordinate organizational efforts toward observable improvements in mission results.</p>
