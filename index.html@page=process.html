						<p>Accelian LLC is a boutique consulting firm specializing in Solution Architecture and Development; Agile Planning; and Financial Management and Strategy. We understand our clients' need to work smarter in a constrained and uncertain budget environment, often with inadequate financial and mission systems. In this context, we prize ourselves on delivering solutions at lower cost to our clients in a shorter period of time compared to large integrators.</p><p>The cornerstone of our company's philosophy is the combination of our lean product and service teams; our focus on fully itemized, solvent financial plans that map to an enterprise service catalog with integrated project and activity level cost reporting capabilities; and an adaptive design and implementation approach to IT systems development.</p><blockquote><p>First, it is our belief that you do no necessarily need more resources, you need the right resources. Our size and deliberate hiring strategy enable us to stay nimble and client-focused. Accelian's flat corporate structure means that there is no one in the company who does not add direct value to the team.</p><p>Second, we believe that increased demand for efficiencies cannot be met without an integrated understanding of cost and operations. Our first focus is on developing solvent, itemized financial plans that map to an enterprise service catalog, based on an internally consistent accounting structure, and sustained by enterprise financial controls. Our custom tracking and reporting tools work with our clients' financial systems to produce timely and accurate financial data, improving the kind and quality of information available to inform management decisions.</p><p>Finally, it is our belief that real solutions only come as a result of a close partnership with our clients and an integration of technology planning with the enterprise business process. Our adaptive design and implementation approach ensures immersion and client stakeholders participation in all activities to facilitate true ownership. This approach also enables our clients' business systems to evolve more quickly toward adherence to a documented design, with resulting gains in interoperability and a reduction in lifecycle system costs.</p></blockquote><p>Our proven ability to deliver has earned the company repeat work with our existing clients. Please see our <a href='index.html@page=success.html'>Successes</a> for additional information about key projects, past and present.</p>
